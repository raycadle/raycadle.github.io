		"content": "Online Accounts\nUse a Password Manager\nA password manager helps you create and store unique passwords for each online service you use. Having a unique password ensures that if one service is hacked, the compromised password wonâ€™t allow access to all of your other accounts.\nAt the very minimum, you should have a unique password for high-value accounts like your email and bank accounts.\nApps\nâ€¢ Bitwarden\nâ€¢ Proton pass\nâ€¢ KeePass\nUse Two-Factor Authentication\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security on top of passwords. It ensures that someone logging into an account is who they say they are by requiring an extra piece of information besides the account password.\nThis extra information is usually either &quot;something you know&quot;, &quot;something you have&quot;, or &quot;something you are&quot; â€” for example, a biometric signal like FaceID.\nYou should not use your phone number as a two-factor method.\nAt the minimum 2FA should be installed on accounts that allow access to other accounts: e.g. an email, Google, or Apple ID. For stronger security, ensure that 2FA is enabled on every service that supports it.\n\n[!NOTE]\nUsing an all-in-one solution like Bitwarden for both password managementÂ andÂ 2FA creates a single point of failure. Take this into account when picking your 2FA client. Be sure to back-up any recovery codes given to you during the 2FA setup process, otherwise you risk locking yourself out of your accounts.\n\nApps\nâ€¢ Aegis\nâ€¢ Bitwarden Authenticator\nâ€¢ Ente Auth\nâ€¢ Bitwarden\nâ€¢ Proton Pass\nâ€¢ KeePass\nUse a Privacy-First Email Provider\nYou should use an email provider that doesnâ€™t read your email or gather data about your conversations to target you with ads.\nServices\nâ€¢ Proton Mail\nâ€¢ Tutanota\nWeb Browsing\nUse a Privacy-First Web Browser\nYou should use a web browser that protects you from tracking, fingerprinting, and unwanted advertisements.\nModern browsers have made it simple to transfer your bookmarks and preferences in order to reduce switching pains.\nApps\nâ€¢ Brave\nâ€¢ Firefox\nâ€¢ Librewolf\nâ€¢ Vivaldi\nâ€¢ Tor\nUse a Privacy-First Search Engine\nYou should use a search engine that protects you from tracking, fingerprinting, and unwanted advertisements. DuckDuckGo is a privacy-first search engine that does not store your search history, has strict location and personalization permissions, and publishes regular content teaching people how to be safer on the web.\nServices\nâ€¢ Startpage\nâ€¢ DuckDuckGo\nâ€¢ Brave Search\nMobile Devices\nCreate a Strong Device Passcode\nA four-digit passcode for your phone or other devices is no longer considered secure. You should use a six-digit passcode at the very minimum, and for extra security use a 12+ character passcode containing both numbers and letters. Biometrics, such as fingerprints and FaceID, should be disabled when traveling internationally, as they are not globally protected by law.\nYou should enforce a strict lock policy on your devices, such as auto-locking after five minutes or less. Always require a passcode immediately after waking the screen and ensure that your devices are not left unattended for more than a minute or two.\nEncrypt Your Devices\nIf your phone or computer is ever stolen, a thief may try to read or export your personal data. If your device is unencrypted, hackers will have access to everything stored on that device, including photos, emails, documents, and contacts.\nYou should enable encryption on every phone and computer you use. Encrypting your devices makes it nearly impossible for a thief to read your data without having your encryption password.\nReview Device Permissions\nYou should review all applications that have access to your files, camera, location, and microphone. Ensure that you trust apps with sensitive permissions.\nKeep Devices Updated\nMany of the most damaging hacks in recent history were only possible because someone failed to update software. While update notifications delivered by your smartphone, computer, and other internet-connected devices can be disruptive,Â applyingÂ those updates in a timely manner is the single-most effective action you can take to protect yourself from these types of attacks.\nYou should apply software updates to every device you own as soon as they are made available, and develop a habit of checking for updates on devices that doÂ notÂ notify you of available patches to ensure their security.\nNetwork Connections\nUse Privacy-Friendly DNS Providers\nDNS (Domain Name Servers) are the internet's equivalent of a phone book. They translate a name like 'google.com' into an IP address. By default, DNS is slow and insecure. Many internet service providers track and log data that flows through DNS, in some cases reselling this data to advertisers.\nA good alternative to your ISP's default is Quad9 (9.9.9.9), which focuses on security and privacy in your everyday browsing. It's a non-profit founded by the Global Cyber Alliance, IBM, and Packet Clearing House, that blocks known malicious domains, and not collect any identifying data from users.\nMore feature-packed alternatives include Adguard and, my personal favorite, NextDNS. These providers allow you to create adblock lists at the DNS level, which is a very powerful implementation of adblocking. This method prevents any requests to ad domains from connecting, which speeds up network connections slightly.\nEnable DNS-over-TLS\nMost modern devices have adopted a network security feature called DNS-over-TLS, or Private DNS in Android's case. This feature overwrites the default DNS provider of whatever network you are on with the one you specify. This allows greater control over your network communication, without needing any repetitive configuration on a per network basis.\nSocial Media &amp; Communication\nRemove Photo Metadata\nGeotagging is the process of adding geographical identification to media files (photos and videos, for example). Anyone who has access to these tagged media files can read this data and learn where the photo was taken. Most social media sites strip the EXIF data from photos, but if you're hosting your own photos, be aware that the geolocation can give away your exact location.\nYou should understand how location metadata is attached to your media and take steps to ensure you are not uploading sensitive information with your files.\nReview Your Social Media Privacy Settings\nOver the years social media companies are able to gather staggering amounts of data about you, your interests, who you talk to, where you go, what you buy, and so much more.\nIf youâ€˜re not ready to give up social media quite yet, you should take the time to review your security and privacy settings. Visualizing the amount of information that social media companies know about you may be enough to curb that unhealthy newsfeed obsession.\nUse Encrypted Messaging Apps\nWhen sharing sensitive information over chat, you should be using a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging service. End-to-end encryption ensures that only you and your intended recipient are able to view messages. Your messages will appear scrambled (and will be nearly-impossible to unscramble) to anyone else, including app developers and ISPs.\nApps\nâ€¢ Signal\nâ€¢ Session\nâ€¢ Whatsapp\nâ€¢ iMessage\nPhysical &amp; Mental Protection\nReview the Privacy of Your Physical Space\nYou should add a webcam cover on your laptop and desktop computers. A webcam cover provides peace of mind when entering and exiting video calls that you are only visible when you choose to be.\nYou should protect yourself from people shoulder-surfing when working in a public space, such as a cafe or on a plane. A privacy screen blocks side views outside a 60 degree viewing angle.\nEducate Yourself About Phishing Attacks\nPhishing is an attempt to obtain sensitive information (like an account password) by disguising as a trustworthy person or company. Phishing often occurs via email where a hacker will use social engineering to convince someone to click a link that goes to a fake login page. The fake login page then sends anything the victim types (including usernames and passwords) to the hacker.\nIn recent years phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and hackers are learning to use data that people put on the web to create highly specific and targeted attacks.\nSmart people are not immune to phishing.\nYou should learn the basics of phishing and how to identify a phishing attempt.",
